 Usage: 
 pcm-power.exe --help | [delay] [options] [-- external_program [external_program_options]]
   <delay>                           => time interval to sample performance counters.
                                        If not specified, or 0, with external program given
                                        will read counters only after external program finishes
 Supported <options> are: 
  -h    | --help  | /h               => print this help and exit
  -silent                            => silence information output and print only measurements
  --version                          => print application version
  -i[=number] | /i[=number]          => allow to determine number of iterations
  -csv[=file.csv] | /csv[=file.csv]  => output compact CSV format to screen or
                                        to a file, in case filename is provided
  [-m imc_profile] [-p pcu_profile] [-a freq_band0] [-b freq_band1] [-c freq_band2]

 Where: imc_profile, pcu_profile, freq_band0, freq_band1 and freq_band2 are the following:
  <imc_profile>      - profile (counter group) for IMC PMU. Possible values are: 0,1,2,3,4,-1 
                       profile  0 - rank 0 and rank 1 residencies (default) 
                       profile  1 - rank 2 and rank 3 residencies 
                       profile  2 - rank 4 and rank 5 residencies 
                       profile  3 - rank 6 and rank 7 residencies 
                       profile  4 - self-refresh residencies 
                       profile -1 - omit IMC PMU output
  <pcu_profile>      - profile (counter group) for PCU PMU. Possible values are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,-1 
                       profile  0 - frequency residencies (default) 
                       profile  1 - core C-state residencies. The unit is the number of physical cores on the socket who were in C0, C3 or C6 during the measurement interval (e.g. 'C0 residency is 3.5' means on average 3.5 physical cores were resident in C0 state)
                       profile  2 - Prochot (throttled) residencies and thermal frequency limit cycles 
                       profile  3 - {Thermal,Power,Clipped} frequency limit cycles 
                       profile  4 - {OS,Power,Clipped} frequency limit cycles 
                       profile  5 - frequency transition statistics 
                       profile  6 - package C-states residency and transition statistics 
                       profile  7 - UFS transition statistics (1) 
                       profile  8 - UFS transition statistics (2) 
                       profile -1 - omit PCU PMU output
  <freq_band0>       - frequency minimum for band 0 for PCU frequency residency profile [in 100MHz units] (default is 12= 1200MHz)
  <freq_band1>       - frequency minimum for band 1 for PCU frequency residency profile [in 100MHz units] (default is 20= 2000MHz)
  <freq_band2>       - frequency minimum for band 2 for PCU frequency residency profile [in 100MHz units] (default is 40= 4000MHz)
